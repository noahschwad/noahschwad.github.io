  description: A proposed exhibition of the pioneering digital designer’s career. Many ideas central to her work are on display in her 3D typography and information landscape prototypes, so I referenced them heavily in the design of the space. Titles are skewed in abstract 3D space, the wall layouts give a sense of depth and motion, and the exhibition allows for a non-linear experience of the content.
