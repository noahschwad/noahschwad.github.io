  description: Kabaj is a family-owned natural winery in Slovenia that utilizes a mix of new and old winemaking techniques. Using the geometric, ornamental grammar of the historic architecture of Ljubljana (Slovenia’s capital city), these data-driven labels are designed to communicate the taste of the wine. This approach makes it easy to select the right wine for the occasion while also making it simple to generate labels for new wines.

  description: A journal of art and ecology for people who live slowly and intentionally. The design is inspired by an imagined point of view of a snail traversing the leaves of a healthy vegetable garden, while also taking typographic cues from homely web 1.0 gardening blogs (where all the best gardening tips come from).

  description: A generative & interactive illustration for Bloomberg Businessweek. Climate researchers are rather absurdly being accused of sensationalizing their findings, so I wanted the viewer to have the absurd experience of sensationalizing the environment.

  description: A proposed exhibition of the pioneering digital designer’s career. Many ideas central to her work are on display in her 3D typography and information landscape prototypes, so I referenced them heavily in the design of the space. Titles are skewed in abstract 3D space, the wall layouts give a sense of depth and motion, and the exhibition allows for a non-linear experience of the content.
