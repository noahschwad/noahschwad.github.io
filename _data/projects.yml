  description: A journal of art and ecology for people who live slowly and intentionally. The design is inspired by an imagined point of view of a snail traversing the leaves of a healthy vegetable garden, while also taking typographic cues from homely web 1.0 gardening blogs (where all the best gardening tips come from).

  description: A proposed exhibition of the pioneering digital designer’s career. Many ideas central to her work are on display in her 3D typography and information landscape prototypes, so I referenced them heavily in the design of the space. Titles are skewed in abstract 3D space, the wall layouts give a sense of depth and motion, and the exhibition allows for a non-linear experience of the content.
