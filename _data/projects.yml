  description: Kabaj is a family-owned natural winery in Slovenia that utilizes a mix of new and old winemaking techniques. Using the geometric, ornamental grammar of the historic architecture of Ljubljana (Slovenia’s capital city), these data-driven labels are designed to communicate the taste of the wine. This approach makes it easy to select the right wine for the occasion while also making it simple to generate labels for new wines.
